**This App allows you to search and filter contacts from râ€‹andomuser.me API**

---

#### &#9881; STACK:

</br>

**React** for frontend,

**Material UI** as a UI library,

**Redux** for state management,

**Reselect** to implement filter and statistics, avoiding performance issues,

**Redux-saga** for asynchronous store update.

</br>
</br>

#### &#9758; COMPLETE MVP:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62475313/95629461-fdb21c80-0a4d-11eb-8cfe-0439f0796cb8.png" alt="Contacts-app" border="0" width="100%">

</br>

**1. Two settings of data viewing:**

**tabular view;**
**tiled view;**

</br>

**2. Contact's list view:**

user's birthday in US format;

email must be clickable using copy;

phone must be clickable with copy;

address must be in the format: / country / street number street name, city, state zip code street number street name, city, state code;

</br>

**3. Ability to filter data with multiple values:**

by full name;

by gender;

by nationality;

More about filter:

Filter happens without manual form submit;

Clearing the filter returns the collection to its original state;

The entire collection gets filtered;

</br>

**4. Data Statistics:**

collection size;

number of men, women and indetermitate;

number of contacts for each nationality;

**What else is there?**

By clicking on the user's name or avatar, there is a transition to the page for viewing user data
When returning from the view page to the contact list page, the previously selected filter, sorting and pagination state must be saved and applied.
